### <span style="color:cornflowerblue">Question 8:	Effects from increased variation. Add one new sample to the data, then add a cover of 9 for the existing species Chenopodium album "Che_alb" in the new sample. Make a new DCA-ordination. <p>Next, remove the Che alb = 9, and add instead a cover of 5 for the exisiting species Leo_aut and make a new DCA. </span>

#### <span style="color:forestgreen"> What happens with the eigenvalues and ordination after adding Che alb and after adding Leo aut? Why did we choose to add these two species in the new sample? </span>

```{r ex8, inclue=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# figure out the column number for Chenopodium album (abbreviated "Chenalbu")
which(colnames(dune)=="Che_alb")
# create a new data frame with a new sample containing Chenopodium album with a cover of 9
NewSample <- c(rep(0,7), 9, rep(0,22))
SpeciesNewSample <- data.frame(rbind(dune, NewSample))
# run a new DCA with the extra sample
DCANewSample <- decorana(SpeciesNewSample)
DCANewSample
# plot the DCA
ordiplot(DCANewSample, type="text", main="DCA with new sample Chenopodium album")
# figure out the column number for Leontodon autumnalis (abbreviated "Leo aut")
which(colnames(dune)=="Leo_aut")
# create a new data frame with a new sample containing Leontodon autumnalis with a cover of 5
NewSample <- c(rep(0,15), 5, rep(0,10))
SpeciesNewSample <- data.frame(rbind(dune, NewSample))
# run a new DCA with the extra sample
DCANewSample <- decorana(SpeciesNewSample)
DCANewSample
# plot the DCA
ordiplot(DCANewSample, type="text", main="DCA with new sample Leontodon autumnalis")
