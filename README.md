# Multivariate course
Conversion of MVM course to R

Open the Questions.html file from the Files list in the bottom right pane (click on it and choose view in web browser). Then open a new R file to work in (from top left menu choose File > New File > R Script, or R Notebook if you are familiar with them). Now you have the questions and the code you can copy paste to your working file to start answering the questions.

Your working file is saved in the cloud when you click the disk icon to save, which is fine, but it would be wise to download it every so often as a backup! (tick the box next to the file name in the bottom right pane, then More > Export from the menu above the files list).

If you mess something up and want to go back to the start you can get the files you started with from the repository they are hosted on at Github (top right pane > Git tab > Pull)
