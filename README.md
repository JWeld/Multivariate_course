# Multivariate methods for ecologists course

This is where you will find the R code for the SLU course [Multivariate Methods for Ecologists](https://www.slu.se/en/departments/aquatic-sciences-assessment/education/post-graduate-education/phd-courses/multivariate-methods-for-ecologists/)

The exercises for each day are found in the appropriate file (Tuesday.rmd etc).

Answers.rmd is a blank notebook that you can use for writing answers or experimenting with code, but you don't have to use this, do whatever works for you!
You don't need to submit written answers for these exercises, instead you will show and explain your answers during the afternoon group work sessions.
