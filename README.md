# Multivariate course
Conversion of MVM course to R

The main file we are developing here is Questions.Rmd, which if you are comfortable with git you can amend and issue a pull request. Otherwise just email me your new sections and I'll do a human merge! Don't worry too much about formatting of the text just yet, e.g. there are some markers for convenient navigation like ##Q12 that will be removed later/ James
